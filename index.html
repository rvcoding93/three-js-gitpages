        <h1>📖 Backstory</h1>
        <p><!--The beginning of this project had a very different trajectory than where we are today. At the beginning of this project I came down with COVID and
          this slowed me down greatly but as I realized my inital idea was not going to have time I made a pivot to work on something else.--> 
          I have been a creator my entire life, I have a deep love and drive to continuously be creating in some capacity. 
          For this reason there was a natural attraction for me to all things visually stimulating in the coding world.
          Naturally, this lead me to frameworks like Three.js and Next.js. for their animation and heavy front end interactability.

Pain is easy to portray, but to use your passion and pain to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world, no one had ever done it before. Perhaps no one ever will again.
